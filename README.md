# Universal Dependencies for Historical Languages (UD4HL)

</div>

UD4HL is a discussion group on the annotation of treebanks of **historical
languages**.

## Why starting this group

We found several reasons to start this discussion group:
	- only few HLs are included in [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/)
	- the number of researchers that actively use treebanks for HLs is limited
	- treebanks of HLs often have errors due to conversions from other formats
	- treebanks of HLs sometimes show inconsistencies in the annotation of comparable contructions
	- HLs lack targeted annotation guidelines for specific construction that don't have straightforward equivalents in modern languages

We believe that creating a discussion group such as UD4HL could improve
communication among scholars who work with historical languages (HLs) and
ultimately lead to better resources and guidelines. Additionally, UD4HL would
improve communication between the communities of HL researchers and UD
developers due to the diverse backgrounds of the individuals in the group.

Our initiative is not intended to replace or compete with the existing UD
community and its ongoing discussions. Rather, we aim to establish a bridge
between researchers who specialize in historical languages and the UD
community. We believe that this collaboration will facilitate mutual learning
and foster a deeper understanding of linguistic diversity.
**Our goal is to complement and enhance the ongoing efforts of the UD
community, rather than to replace them.**

## Outcomes

As an outcome of the discussions we plan to carry on within this group, we
expect to start a process of correction and standardization of the already
existing resources and to write better guidelines for researchers that will
annotate treebanks for HLs in the future.

Some preliminnary results were presented at the workshop [**Exploiting standardized
cross-linguistic data in historical linguistics**](https://www.slav.uni-heidelberg.de/md/slav/forschung/tagungen/ichl26/ichl26_selected_workshops.pdf)
organized by Robert Forkel, Gerard JÃ¤ger and Johann-Mattis List at the
[**International Conference on Historical Linguistics** (ICHL26, 4-8 September 2023)](https://www.slav.uni-heidelberg.de/forschung/tagungen/ichl26/index.html).

You can download the presentation from [here] (https://github.com/unipv-larl/UD4HL/blob/main/ICHL_presentation.pdf).

## How to take part in the discussion

We plan to conduct our discussion in the
[issue page](https://github.com/unipv-larl/UD4HL/issues) of this repository.

We will also use this space to share information about what researchers in this
group are doing or have already done related to treebanks and HLs. Information
about these projects will be collected [here](treebank_projects); this will
allow the community to know about the ongoing projects and collaborate, if
possible.

If you want to share information about your project(s), please send the
relevant information about the project(s) to [luca.brigadavilla@unibg.it](mailto:luca.brigadavilla@unibg.it).
