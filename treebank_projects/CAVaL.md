# Classical Armenian Valency Lexicon (CAVaL)

The **Classical Armenian Valency Lexicon (CAVaL)** project aims to create a
corpus-based valency lexicon of *Classical Armenian*. The project will result
in a corpus of texts annotated in the UD framework, and a web-application
enabling search queries of argument structures, their morphological expression
and lexical distribution with text frequencies, in line with digital valency
lexica of other ancient Indo-European languages, in particular Latin
([IT-VaLex](itreebank.marginalia.it)) and Homeric Greek
([HoDeL](hodel.unipv.it/hodel-res)). The project is funded by the DFG and is
based at the [Chair of Comparative Philology of the University of WÃ¼rzburg](https://www.phil.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/vgsp/home/).
