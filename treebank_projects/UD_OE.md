# UD_OE

The project consists in the conversion of the already existing constituency
treebanks for Old English - York-Toronto-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Old English
Prose (YCOE) and The York-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Old English Poetry (YCOEP) -
into the UD format.

This would allow a greater user-friendliness of the data, enabling to add
further information, not present in the original treebanks, such as
lemmatization.

The project is based at the University of Pavia.
